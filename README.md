(a) Calculate control   limits for an   R-chart and   anX(̅)-Chart.   Please   use three-standard-deviation   limits,   and the standard deviation   is calculated with      (5   points)
(b) After these   data   are   collected,   some   new   employees   are   hired. A   new   sample   obtained   is   as follows:   625,   692,   612, and   635.   Is the   process still   in control?   (5   points)3.   Pioneer   Chicken   advertises “lite”   chicken   with   30   percent fewer   calories. The   process   mean for   “lite”   chicken   breasts   is   420   calories,   with   a   standard   deviation   of   25   calories.   The   product   design   calls for the      average   chicken   breast   to   contain   400   ±   100   calories.   Calculate   the    process   capability   index   and   the      modified   process capability   index.   Use three standard deviations.   (5   points)4. A company produces plastic powder in lots of 2000 pounds at the beginning of each week. The company   uses   the   powder   in   an   injection   molding   process   at the   steady   rate   of   50   pounds   per   hour,   for   an   eight-   hour   day, five   days   a week. The   manager   has   indicated that the   cost of   placing   an   order   is   $100,   but   “we   really   have   not determined what the   holding cost   is”   .
(a) What weekly holding cost rate does the   lot size   imply,   assuming the   lot size   2000   is   optimal?   (5   points)(b) Suppose the figure you compute for weekly holding cost rate has been shown to the   manager,   and the   manager says that it is   not that   high. Would   that   mean   the   lot   size   2000   is   too   large   or   too   small?   Explain   in at   most two sentences.   (5   points)5.   A   company   is   using   the   re-order   point   model   to   manage   the   inventory   of   a   certain   kind   of   product.   Currently,   the   inventory   system   uses   an   economic   order   quantity   of   600   units.   Consider   the   following   situations:(a) Suppose the   company   is   able to get   much   cheaper transportation   such   that   the   setup   cost   is   reduced      from    $90    per    order      to      $10      per      order.      Everything      else      remains      unchanged.      Do      you      have      sufficient      information to determine the new economic order quantity? If not, explain why; if   yes, what is it? (5 points)(b)   Suppose   the   company   is   able   to   negotiate   a   lower   wholesale   price   from   its   supplier,   from   $14.4   per   unit to $10 per unit.   Everything else remains unchanged.   Do you   have sufficient   information to   determine   the   new economic order quantity?   If   not, explain why;   if yes,   what   is   it?   (5   points)
(c)   Suppose   the   optimal   order   quantity   obtained   from   the   basic   EOQ   formula   is   600   units   per   order.   In   addition, the total   inventory   holding   cost for   one whole year   is   $600.   Do you   have   sufficient   information   to determine the company’s inventory holding cost per   unit   per   year for this   product?   If   not,   explain why;   if yes, what   is   it?   (5   points)
6. ABC   Farm is a cranberry grower.   It is   now April   1st    and ABC   is about to enter   into   a   contract   to   sell   all   its   cranberries to the Ocean Place Company. ABC’s cranberry crop will be harvested and processed in the fall.   The quantity of cranberries produced by ABC is uncertain and follows a normal distribution. ABC estimates   that   the   yield   (the   quantity   of   berries)   available   in   the   fall   has   a   mean   of   10,000   barrels   and   a   standard   deviation of   1,500   barrels.For the current contract, ABC   must specify now how many   barrels   it   promises to sell to   Ocean   Place   in the   fall. The selling   price is $500   per barrel, and under the   contract, ABC   is   prohibited from selling   cranberries   to anyone but Ocean   Place. ABC will   pay a penalty of $200 for   each   barrel that   is   short   of what   it   promises   to deliver.   For example, if ABC   promises to deliver   5,000   barrels   but   can   only   deliver 4,500   barrels,   Ocean   Place would   pay ABC   a total   of   500×4,500−200×(5,000−4,500).       If ABC   can   deliver   all the   5,000   barrels   as   promised, Ocean   Place would   pay ABC a total of   500×5,000.On September   1st    ABC will   knowhow   many   berries are available.   If the   number   of   barrels   is   less than the   number they   have   promised to deliver, ABC will   process and deliver   all   of the   berries that   are   available代 写Individual Assignment 4SQL
代做程序编程语言.   If   the    number   of   barrels   available   is   greater   than   the    number   they    have    promised   to   deliver,   they   will   process   and   deliver   only   the   number   that   has   been   promised.   For   each   barrel   delivered to   Ocean   Place,   ABC also   needs to incura cost of   $100   for   processing.
(a)   How   much should ABC   promise to sell and deliver to   Ocean   Place?   (5   points)
(b) With your answer to (a), what is the   probability that ABC can   NOT deliver   the full   amount   it   promises?   (5   points)
(c)   Suppose   when   ABC   cannot   harvest   and   process   up   to   the   amount   they   promise   to   deliver,   they   can   makeup for the shortfall   by buying from another grower at a   price of   $600.   No   processing   cost   is charged   for this amount.   How   much should ABC   promise to sell and   deliver?   (5   points)
(d) Suppose there   is another   identical grower,   DEF. The quantity   of cranberries   available   to   DEF   in   the   fall   has a normal distribution with a mean of   10,000   barrels and a standard   deviation   of   1,500   barrels,   and the   cost to   DEF to   process   and   deliver   is   $100   per   barrel. Assume   that   buying   from   another   grower to   make   up for   the   shortfall   is   not   possible.   Suppose   DEF   can   make   an   agreement with   Ocean   Place   with   exactly   the same terms as stated above. Therefore,   both ABC and DEF would promise to sell and deliver the   same   amounts of cranberry as your answer to   (a).   Now suppose   ABC   merges   with   DEF.   Assume   the   amounts   of   cranberry   available   in   the   fall   to   these   two   growers   are   independent.    How    much   should   the    merged   company   promise to sell and deliver?   (5   points)7. A firm is managing its inventory system   using order-up-to   policy,   and   orders   everyday.   For   the first   100   days, truck transportation   is   used and the   lead time   is 2 days. The corresponding   order-up-to   level   is   150.   On the   96th    day, the firm orders 45; on the   97th    day, the firm   orders   50.(a) Consider a case that the manager thinks that truck transportation is too expensive. Thus, starting from   the order of the   101st    day, train transportation is used and the lead time   becomes 3.   Correspondingly, the   order-up-to   level   is changed to 200.   Fill   in the following form. (5   points)
(b)   Consider   a   case that the   manager thinks that truck transportation   is too   slow.   Thus,   starting   from   the   order of the 101st   day, air transportation is used and the lead time becomes 1. Correspondingly, the order-   up-to   level   is changed to   110.   Fill   in the following form. (5   points)

(c)   Suppose   that   the   demand   for   each   day   follows   a   normal   distribution   with   mean   45   and   standard   deviation   3.   What   is   the   service   level   for the   first   100   days?   What   is the   service   level   after   the   101st      day for   (a)? What is the service   level after   the   101st      day for   (b)?   (5   points)
8. The   Innat   Penn   hotel   has   300   rooms with standard   queen-size   beds and   two   rates:   a full   price of   $400   and   a   discount   price   of $240. To   receive the   discount   price,a   customer   must   purchase the   room   at   least   two   weeks   in   advance   (this   helps   to   distinguish   between   leisure   travelers,   who   tend   to   book   early,   and   business   travelers,   who   value   the   flexibility   of   booking   late).   For   a   particular   Tuesday   night,   the   hotel   estimates   that   the   demand   from    leisure   travelers   could   fill   the   whole    hotel    while   the    demand   from   business travelers   is distributed   normally with a   mean of   140   rooms and   a   standard   deviation   of   60.
(a) Suppose 100 rooms are protected for full-price rooms. What is the booking limit   for the discount rooms?   (5   points)
(b)   Find the optimal   protection   level for full-price   rooms   (the   number of   rooms to   be   protected from sale   at a discount   price).   (5   points)(c) The Sheraton   located   nearby declared a   price   war   by setting   business travelers’   price   to   $300.   The   Inn   at   Penn   has   to   match   that   price   to   keep   demand   at   the   same   level.   Does   the   optimal   protection   level   increase, decrease, or   remain the same?   Explain your answer.   (5   points)9.   In   a   Tom      Jerry   supply   chain,   Tom   is   the   manufacturer   and   Jerry   is   the   retailer.   The   supply   chain   is   going    to    offer    a      new    T-shirt    for    the      next      summer      selling      season.      The      following      events      take      place   sequentially:
(i) Tom offers Jerry a wholesale   price   of   $4.
(ii) Jerry   decideshow   much   to   order,Q, from   Tom.
(iii) Tom   produces   Q   units of the T-shirt at a   unit   production cost of   $2   and   deliver   them   to Jerry.
(iv) The selling season starts and Jerry sellsT-shirts at a   retailer price of $10.   Suppose   the   demand   follows   a   normal distribution with   mean   100 and standard deviation   20.
(v) The selling season ends and all the   leftover   T-shirts,   if   any,   are   thrown   away.   Answer the following questions:
(a)   How   much should Jerry   order to   maximize   his   own   profit?   How   much should Jerry   order to   maximize   the overall   profit of the supply chain?   (5   points)(b)   Now   Tom   considers   offering   Jerry   a   buyback   price r,   which   means   that   he   will    buy   all   the   leftover   inventory from   Jerry at the end of the selling season. Tom’s purpose is   that, when   Jerry maximizes his own   profit, he is also maximizing the overall profit of   the supply chain. What should the value of r   be? (5 points)(c) Tom   has another   plan.   He can   promise to Jerry that, for any quantity of T-shirts sold beyond   100 units,   a   unit sales   rebate   of A will   be   awarded.   What should the value   of A   be   to   achieve   the   same   purpose?   (5   points)
10. So, any final comments for the   course   before   it   ends?   (optional)
